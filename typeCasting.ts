Type Casting in TypeScript
Type casting in TypeScript allows developers to override the default type inference and explicitly specify the type of a value. It is useful when you know more about the type of a value than TypeScript can infer.

Why Use Type Casting?
Access specific properties/methods: When TypeScript cannot infer the type, you can cast the value to the desired type to access its specific properties or methods.
Handle dynamic data: For example, data from APIs or user inputs that could have uncertain types.
Avoid TypeScript errors: To inform the compiler about the intended type.
Type Casting Syntax

Angle Bracket Syntax:
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, World!";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;

..as Syntax (Recommended)
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, World!";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

1. Casting to a String
let value: unknown = 42;
let valueAsString: string = value as string; // Not valid logically, but no error
console.log(valueAsString.length); // Undefined behavior at runtime

3. Casting to Handle DOM Elements
const inputElement = document.getElementById("user-input") as HTMLInputElement;
inputElement.value = "Hello, Ayaad!";
Double Casting
When dealing with complex types or circumventing strict type checks, double casting can be used:

let someData: unknown = "Example";
let doubleCast = someData as unknown as number; 

Difference Between as and Angle Brackets
Angle Brackets: Cannot be used in .tsx files (conflicts with JSX syntax).
as Syntax: Works in all TypeScript files, recommended for compatibility.
Type Assertions vs Type Casting
Type Assertion: Informs the compiler about the intended type of a value.
Type Casting: Converts a value to a different type at runtime (in other languages like C# or Java).
In TypeScript, type casting is effectively a form of type assertion, not a runtime operation.

Safety Concerns
Type casting does not check the validity of the cast at runtime.
If the cast is incorrect, it might lead to runtime errors.

let num: number = 42;
let str: string = num as unknown as string; // No compile-time error
console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // Runtime error
Best Practices
Use type casting sparingly and only when necessary.
Prefer strong typing and avoid excessive use of any or unknown.
Always validate dynamic data at runtime before casting.
  
Note: Type casting in TypeScript is a way to explicitly specify the type of a value.
